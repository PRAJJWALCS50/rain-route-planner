# üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Setup

## Current Issue
Your GitHub Pages is showing a 404 error because it's looking for an `index.html` file in the root directory, but your React app builds to `client/build/`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Created GitHub Actions Workflow
- **File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Purpose:** Automatically builds and deploys your React app to GitHub Pages
- **Triggers:** On every push to main branch

### 2. ‚úÖ Added Root Index.html
- **File:** `index.html` (in root)
- **Purpose:** Redirects to the built React app
- **Fallback:** Manual link if redirect fails

### 3. ‚úÖ Updated Package.json
- **Added:** `homepage` field pointing to your GitHub Pages URL
- **Purpose:** Ensures React builds with correct base path

### 4. ‚úÖ Added Redirects File
- **File:** `_redirects`
- **Purpose:** Handles routing for single-page application

## Next Steps

### Enable GitHub Pages in Repository Settings:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Click on "Settings" tab**
3. **Scroll down to "Pages" section**
4. **Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"**
5. **Save the settings**

### The deployment will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Build your React app
- ‚úÖ Deploy to GitHub Pages
- ‚úÖ Update on every push to main

## Your GitHub Pages URL:
**https://prajjwalcs50.github.io/rain-route-planner**

## Important Notes:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backend API Limitation**: GitHub Pages only serves static files, so your backend API won't work. For full functionality, use Vercel deployment.

‚úÖ **Frontend Only**: This setup will deploy your React frontend, but API calls will need to point to your Vercel backend.

## Alternative: Use Vercel for Full Stack
For complete functionality (frontend + backend), continue using Vercel deployment as configured earlier.
